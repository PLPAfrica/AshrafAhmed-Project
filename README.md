SQL Assignment

1. The SELECT statement in SQL retrieves data from a database table. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve, as well as any conditions or expressions to filter or manipulate the data.

  ### Here's a simple example of a SELECT statement retrieving all columns from a table:  
- ```SQL SELECT * FROM tableName; ```  This statement retrieves all columns (`*`) from the table named `tableName`.

2. The SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses in SQL queries work together as follows:  - SELECT: Specify the columns you want to retrieve from the table. - FROM: Specifies the table from which you want to retrieve the data. - WHERE: Filters the rows retrieved from the table based on specified conditions.
3. Here's a simple example demonstrating their combined use:  ```SQL SELECT column1, column2  FROM tableName  WHERE condition; ```
   - This statement selects `column1` and `column2` from the table named `tableName`, but only for rows that meet the specified `condition`.
